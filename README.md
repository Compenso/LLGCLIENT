# Little-Life-Goals
  The whole world seems complex at the very least of it's own self, but this is not entirely true.  It's rather a complexity of simple matters.  Fortunately, so are goals, and because of that, even the biggest goal can be broken down into smaller parts and then tossed into a system.  

## Deployment

Before deploying, you first need to make sure the `homepage` key in your
`package.json` is pointing to the correct value. It should be the url of your
deployed application.

To deploy you should first make sure you are on the `master` branch with a
clean working directory, then you can run `npm run deploy` and wait to see if
it runs successfully.

## About


## Structure



## Features

### `<AuthenticatedRoute />`


### `<AutoAlertDismiss />` Component

This template also already contains a component that displays user messages.
Messages are configurable via redux actions.  This component can be found in
`src/components/AutoAlertDismiss/AutoAlertDismiss.js`. **There is no need to add
this component to your app. It is already required in `App`.**  A single
component instance is used to manage all alerts application-wide.

The alert can be used by passing the `alertMsg` method to a rendered route.  The
`alertMsg` method expects an object with a `heading`, `message`, and a `variant` property.

Use this component in conjunction with the `messages.js` file in the same
directory to create and manage all of your application messages in one place.

The `variant` property must be a Bootstrap alert variant, as this component is merely a
wrapper around the [react-bootstrap Alert
component](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/).  The types it
will accept are: 'primary', 'secondary', 'success', 'danger', 'warning', 'info',
'light', and 'dark'.

 To change the duration of the message, replace `5000` with a value of your
 choice (in milliseconds) in this component's `componentDidMount` method.

### `src/apiConfig.js`

Just like in
[browser-template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template),
this file will determine whether you're in a production or development
environment and choose an API URL accordingly. Don't forget to replace the
`production` URL with your deployed API's URL.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `npm run nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `npm run make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
  Style.
- `npm run start`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads.
- `npm run build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `npm run deploy`: builds and deploys master branch
